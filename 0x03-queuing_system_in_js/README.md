# User Queuing System in JavaScript

## Overview

This repository contains a user queuing system implemented in JavaScript. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage asynchronous tasks and execute them in a specific order while handling user requests in a queued manner.

## Features

- **Task Queue**: Manages a queue of tasks.
- **Execution Order**: Executes tasks in the order they are added to the queue.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Handles asynchronous operations efficiently.
- **User Request Handling**: Demonstrates the usage of a queuing system for handling user requests.

## Installation

To run this queuing system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-queuing-system.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd user-queuing-system
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

### Adding Tasks to the Queue

To add tasks to the queue, use the `addTaskToQueue` function:

```javascript
addTaskToQueue(() => {
  // Your asynchronous task goes here
});
```

### Task Execution

Tasks in the queue will be executed in the order they were added. The system ensures that one task is completed before starting the next.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the user queuing system:

```javascript
// Adding tasks to the queue
addTaskToQueue(() => asyncTask(1));
addTaskToQueue(() => asyncTask(2));
addTaskToQueue(() => asyncTask(3));
```

### API Reference

#### `addTaskToQueue(task)`

Adds a task to the queue for execution.

- `task`: A function representing the asynchronous task to be added to the queue.

#### `asyncTask(value)`

An example asynchronous task.

- `value`: A parameter representing the value of the task.
